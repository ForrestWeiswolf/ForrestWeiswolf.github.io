<section id="about">
  <p>I'm Forrest Wolf, a software engineer, musician, and effective altruist. Currently living in Brooklyn, NY; previously Des Moines, IA.</p>
  <p>This website contains links to several of my projects, as well as a few miscellanea which I thought were worth having up on the internet for one reason or another.</p>
