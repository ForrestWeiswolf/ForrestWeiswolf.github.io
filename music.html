<div>
  <p>Music is a large part of my life, though I've never tried to make a living off it.</p>
  <p>I'm a songwriter, play the bowed psaltery, and sing frequently even though I never got to be much good at it.</p>
  <p>
    Every year, I participate in February Album Writing Month (FAWM), a challenge to write and record an album during the month of February. Most of these aren't currently available, as mixing and arranging is a much longer process than songwriting; but links to a few songs that are further along in that process or otherwise noteworthy can be found on this page.

  <p>Some projects I've worked on can be found below.</p>

      <p>I play a rather unusual instrument called a bowed psaltery.
        <a href="">Here's</a> an explanation of what it's like.</p>

        Every year, I participate in February Album Writing Month, a challenge to write and record an album during the month of February. In 2018, I wrote eleven songs comprising the album I have titled Domains and Angles, which centers on themes of the difficulty of communication, the changing nature of the city in which I live, and non-euclidean geometry.

        The full album is not currently available, as mixing and arranging is a much longer process than songwriting, but a sample song, The Season of Rust, can be found <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-957283792/the-season-of-rust-fawm-demo">here</a>.
