  <p>I'm a songwriter, play the bowed psaltery, and sing frequently even though I never got to be much good at it.</p>
  <p>
    Every year, I participate in February Album Writing Month (FAWM), a challenge to write and record an album during the month of February. Most of these aren't currently available, as mixing and arranging is a much longer process than songwriting; but links to a few songs that are further along in that process or otherwise noteworthy can be found on this page.
  </p>
  <p>A few of the projects I've worked on can be found below.</p>

      <p>I play a rather unusual instrument called a bowed psaltery.

      Domains and Angles

    <div class="project-info right-side">
      <p>
          During February Album Writing Month 2018, I wrote eleven songs comprising the album I have titled <i>Domains and Angles</i>, which centers on themes of the difficulty of communication, the changing nature of the city in which I live, and non-euclidean geometry.

    <div class="project-info right-side">
      <p>When practcing a song, I sometimes want to play and record a very short part of it, listen to that in order to hear whether I got the timing right, then repeat, potentially repeating this many times in a row.</p>
      <p>Putting down my bow to reset the recording every time is inconvenient and distracting when working on a section that's only seconds long, so I made this webpage, which records for a specified number of seconds, plays it back, then waits a specified number of seconds before starting over.</p>
