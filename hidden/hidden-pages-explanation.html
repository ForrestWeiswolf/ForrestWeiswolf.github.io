<h2>What is this?</h2>

<p>This section of my site consists of hidden pages, the contents of which can't be read without a key.</p>

<h2>Why?</h2>

<p>I wanted to have non-public pages on this site, that I could send people a link to but that couldn't be found otherwise. However, the site is fully open-source, so normally, even if I don't link to a page anywhere it can be found in the Github repo. Also, because I thought it would be interesting.</p>

<h2>How?</h2>

<p>Basically, the content of the page is encrypted, and there's some Javascript code that will attempt to decrypt it using a key in the URL's query string. So I can send people I want to share a given page with a link containing the key, but anyone else will only be able to see the encrypted HTML.</p>

<p>Each page has a different key, so I can share one without revealing all of them.</p>

<h2>Is it secure?</h2>

<p>Not particularly.</p>
<p>(I'm aware of the standard advice to not roll your own crypto, and while this does use AES, it uses it in a nonstandard manner. Also, I set it up quickly, without spending a lot of time making sure things are fully secure, so it should be presumed that they are not fully secure.)</p>
<p>In most circumstances, I wouldn't recommend an approach like this without much more careful thought about whether it works and is appropriate. In this particular case, however, the stakes are very low, since I don't plan to put anything genuinely secret here, and I thought it would be interesting to try it out.</p>
