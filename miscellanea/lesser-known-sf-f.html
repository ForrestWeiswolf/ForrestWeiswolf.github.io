title: Favorite lesser-known SF&F
---
<div>
  <p>At some point, I made a list of 'Favorite SF&F that someone who likes many of the same books as me might not have heard of'. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Dimension of Miracles, by Robert Sheckley</li>
    <li>Blue and Gold, by K. J. Parker</li>
    <li>Invisible Cities, by Italo Calvino</li>
    <li>The Collapsium, by Wil McCarthy</li>
    <li>A Madness of Angels, by Kate Griffin</li>
    <li>Radiance, by Cathrynne Valente</li>
  </ul>
  <p>(Honorary mention: Every Heart A Doorway, by Seanan McGuire. While it seems like hardly anybody I know has read it, a book that won the Hugo <i>and</i> Nebula can'r really be considered 'lesser-known SF&F')</p>
