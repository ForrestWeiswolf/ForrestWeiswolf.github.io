    <p>These are all genuine questions that I have been asked multiple times. Make of that what you will.</p>

    <h4>What tech stack do you use?</h4>
    <p>About half of my experience is with React; the other half is quite varied.</p>
    <p>Languages and frameworks I have used professionally, in rough order of familiarity, include Typescript, Javascript (React, ReactNative, Express and Sequelize), Python (Django) Kotlin (Spring Boot), Java (Spring Boot) Swift, Go, C# (Dotnet).</p>

    <h4>Are you British?</h4>
    <p>I've often been told I have a British accent. This is strange, as I haven't spent a significant amount of time in Britain, nor do I have any family from there. My brother seems to have the same accent I do, but we've never figured out where we got it. Notably, we've only been told this by Americans; it doesn't sound British to actual British people.</p>

    <h4>Are you from the South?</h4>
    <p>No, I thought "y'all" was a good idea, so I adopted it into my vocabulary.</p>

    <h4>What's that instrument you play?</h4>
    <p><a href="./psaltery.html">Bowed psaltery.</a></p></p>

    <h4>How are you?</h4>
    <p>Fine, thanks. How're you?*</p>
    <sub>* I believe that this exchange is generally used as a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phatic_expression>phatic expression</a>; in some cases, my response here may thus be intended more as 'giving the correct password in a standard protocol' than as a statement of fact.</sub>

    <h4>Read anything interesting lately?</h4>
    <p>(I'm not going to keep the website up to date on this, but if you want an idea what sort of things I read in general, <a href="./miscellanea/books-2021.html">this list</a> should help.)</p>

    <h4>What's the password?</h4>
